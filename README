# groundtest

A memory tester circuit for Rocket Chip's memory system. The generator tile
plugs into the existing SoC generator as what looks like a CPU. However,
instead of running programs, the tile generates fixed memory requests out to
the L2. There are both cached and uncached generators. The cached generator
has an intervening L1 cache, the uncached generator sends TileLink requests
directly to the L2.

Assertions are set to fail if the wrong data comes back or if a request times
out waiting for the response.
